## Reporting a vulnerability

To responsibly report a security issue, please select one of the options below:
* Navigate to the "Security" tab for the repo, and click "Report a vulnerability"
* Mail me at itsme@somespecial.one with a short and descriptive subject


Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report and be explicit. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help address the issue faster.
